Repository for use with Madrid Libraries Project

<h1>Setup</h1>
The first step is to setup your XAMPP environment so that you can host the webapp locally.
Go to https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and download the correct version for your system.
Complete the install. 
Once the installation is complete, go to your xampp folder and delete the mysql and htdocs files.
Copy and paste xampp_mysql and xampp_htdocs into your xampp folder. 
Remove the xampp_ from both files.

Congratulations, you are now set up!

<h1>Launching the webapp</h1>
Launch your XAMPP application and start the apache server and MySQL by clicking.
Open your favorite web browser (Site tested in Google Chrome, others may act weird) and type localhost/MadridLibrariesProject in the search bar. 
When you are done using the site, close your browser and stop the apache server and MySQL in XAMPP.
